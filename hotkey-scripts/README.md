## hotkey-scripts
While all scripts can be assigned a keybind, this folder contains scripts that are specifically intended to address the issues with SynthV's somewhat lacking keybind options, improve workflow, and reduce reliance on a mouse.

These scripts perform a very basic funtion (such as moving a note up or down) and do not open any dialog boxes. Some of these scripts (such as moving notes around the piano roll) are extremely similar since each script must be assigned a separate hotkey.
