# svstudio-scripts
A collection of scripts for Synthesizer V Studio Pro

Most scripts will have comments within the first few lines explaining the purpose and usage of the script, and in some cases there will be comments explaining how to customize it.

## how to use scripts
Scripts are only available for the Pro edition of SynthV Studio. You can find the scripts folder by opening SynthV Studio and selecting Scripts -> Open Scripts Folder from the top menu. Download the scripts you wish to use from this repository and place them in the scripts folder. To access the new scripts in SynthV Studio, either restart the software or select Scripts -> Rescan from the top menu.

## hotkey-scripts
While all scripts can be assigned a keybind, the "hotkey-scripts" folder contains scripts that are specifically intended to address the issues with SynthV's somewhat lacking keybind options, improve workflow, and reduce reliance on a mouse.

These scripts perform a very basic funtion (such as moving a note up or down) and do not open any dialog boxes unless absolutely necessary. Some of these scripts (such as moving notes around the piano roll) are extremely similar since each script must be assigned a separate hotkey.

## modifying these scripts or making your own
Feel free to copy, modify, fork, etc. these scripts. Crediting me is appreciated but optional. You can find the scripting documentation for SynthV Studio here: https://resource.dreamtonics.com/scripting/index.html
